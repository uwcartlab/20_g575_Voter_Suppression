      <div class="paragraph">
        <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Welcome</h2>
        <p>From the federal level to the local level, governments in the United States of America have been
          proposing, passing, and implemeting policies and laws that influence people's ability to vote in
          the country. This website briefly presents recent data pertaining to state legislation on voting.
          While there are many laws that impact one's ability to vote during a given election in the country,
          several important ones are presented in the map above and explained in more detail below.
          Some states are more enabling than others, passing laws that make it easier to vote. Other states are
          stricter, making it more difficult to vote. This data is especially relevant now as many states
          have gotten stricter with their voting laws, with one key moment being the decision reached in the
          <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em> Supreme Court case in 2013. A key dimension in the issue of voting
          laws is that of voter suppression, the systematic disabling and discouragement of minority votes.
        </p>
        <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Background</h3>
        <p>People need to meet certain requirements before they are able to vote in the United States.
          One requirement is that one must be a U.S. citizen. Citizenship eligibility has changed throughout
          the nation's history, which, among other privileges, has affected voting eligibilties of certain people.
          The Fourteenth Amendment largely contributed toward the ability for African Americans to vote. As
          another example, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was the first step toward U.S.-born Native Americans
          voting.
        </p>
        <p>In both of these cases, however, other laws had to pass and be implemented for mass enablement,
          especially at the state level. For example, individual states still prohibited Native Americans from
          voting despite their status as citizens. This illustrates the importance of legislation and policy
          aligning at all levels for truly empowering people with the ability to vote.
        </p>
        <p>Many of the recent laws passed at the state level relate to the other basic requirements of voting.
          One must be 18 years old in order to vote, but some states make it easier for 18 year old people to vote
          than others. <em>(see early voting status)</em> One has to to vote in their assigned district, which is
          differentailly enforced state by state. <em>(see provisional votes)</em> Registration is another prerequisite,
          which is easier in some states than others. <em>(see online registration)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is at the state level where many of the federal decisions come to fruition or become practically
          useless. Today, state governments enjoy greater freedom regarding voting laws than they did before, largely
          because of the 5-4 Supreme Court decision in <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fifteenth Amendment protects citizens from discriminatory voting prohibitions, most notably
          racist prohibitions. Following the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, the States took advatange
          of their rights, courtesy of the Tenth Amendment and Article Four of the Consitution, to undo its enfranchisement.
          Voter suppression infamously manifested as literacy tests and poll taxes, along with other tactics that
          usually hindered black Americans from voting. Nearly a century after the Fifteenth Amendment, one of the
          country's most important voting rights acts (1965) prohibited certain districts from changing their election
          laws. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 targeted very suppressive districts. These districts were then obligated
          to report their intention to not negatively impact minorities whenever they changed their election process.
          These places had voting tests and less than a 50 % voter turnout in 1964.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was brought into question in <em>Shelby County v.
          Holder.</em> The sections of interest were those that made places prove to the either Attorney General or a D.C.
          district court judge panel that they were not discriminating against minorites. The 5-4 decision was that Section
          4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was unconstitutional. To justify the decision, the judges said that the discrimination
          targeted by the Section was not what it used it be. Once that decision passed, states no longer had to answer
          to an authority concerning the potentially negative effects of their election laws. The result has been stricter laws,
          which, like before, act to suppress minority votes.
