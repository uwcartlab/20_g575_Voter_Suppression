              <div class="paragraph">
                <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Welcome</h2>
                <p>From the federal level to the local level, governments in the United States of America have been
                  proposing, passing, and implemeting policies and laws that influence people's ability to vote in
                  the country. This website briefly presents recent data pertaining to state legislation on voting.
                  While there are many laws that impact one's ability to vote during a given election in the country,
                  several important ones are presented in the map above and explained in more detail below.
                  Some states are more enabling than others, passing laws that make it easier to vote. Other states are
                  stricter, making it more difficult to vote. This data is especially relevant now as many states
                  have gotten stricter with their voting laws, with one key moment being the decision reached in the
                  <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em> Supreme Court case in 2013. A key dimension in the issue of voting
                  laws is that of voter suppression, the systematic disabling and discouragement of minority votes.
                </p>
                <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Background</h3>
                <p>People need to meet certain requirements before they are able to vote in the United States.
                  One requirement is that one must be a U.S. citizen. Citizenship eligibility has changed throughout
                  the nation's history, which, among other privileges, has affected voting eligibilties of certain people.
                  The Fourteenth Amendment largely contributed toward the ability for African Americans to vote. As
                  another example, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was the first step toward U.S.-born Native Americans
                  voting.
                </p>
                <p>In both of these cases, however, other laws had to pass and be implemented for mass enablement,
                  especially at the state level. For example, individual states still prohibited Native Americans from
                  voting despite their status as citizens. This illustrates the importance of legislation and policy
                  aligning at all levels for truly empowering people with the ability to vote.
                </p>
                <p>Many of the recent laws passed at the state level relate to the other basic requirements of voting.
                  One must be 18 years old in order to vote, but some states make it easier for 18 year old people to vote
                  than others. <em>(see early voting status)</em> One has to to vote in their assigned district, which is
                  differentailly enforced state by state. <em>(see provisional votes)</em> Registration is another prerequisite,
                  which is easier in some states than others. <em>(see online registration)</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is at the state level where many of the federal decisions come to fruition or become practically
                  useless. Today, state governments enjoy greater freedom regarding voting laws than they did before, largely
                  because of the 5-4 Supreme Court decision in <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Fifteenth Amendment protects citizens from discriminatory voting prohibitions, most notably
                  racist prohibitions. Following the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, the States took advatange
                  of their rights, courtesy of the Tenth Amendment and Article Four of the Consitution, to undo its enfranchisement.
                  Voter suppression infamously manifested as literacy tests and poll taxes, along with other tactics that
                  usually hindered black Americans from voting. Nearly a century after the Fifteenth Amendment, one of the
                  country's most important voting rights acts (1965) prohibited certain districts from changing their election
                  laws. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 targeted very suppressive districts. These districts were then obligated
                  to report their intention to not negatively impact minorities whenever they changed their election process.
                  These places had voting tests and less than a 50 % voter turnout in 1964.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was brought into question in <em>Shelby County v.
                  Holder.</em> The sections of interest were those that made places prove to the either Attorney General or a D.C.
                  district court judge panel that they were not discriminating against minorites. The 5-4 decision was that Section
                  4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was unconstitutional. To justify the decision, the judges said that the discrimination
                  targeted by the Section was no longer an issue. Once that decision passed, states no longer had to answer
                  to an authority concerning the potentially negative effects of their election laws. The result has been stricter laws,
                  which, like before, act to suppress minority votes.
                </p>
                <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Early Voting Status</h3>
                <p>
                  Early voting in the United States initially served to accommodate rural voters who had to travel far to cast a ballot.
                  This practice dwindled into late 20th century, with many states only offering an option for absentee voting. Even then,
                  an excuse had to provided, as is still the case in some states. There are drawbacks to early in-person voting
                  such as greater costs for campaigning and the possibility of prematurely casting a vote. The recent resurgence of early voting
                  in most states has been largely an accessibility issue. Many Americans do if fact vote before election day, with probably a third
                  of them doing so during the 2010s. While there are a number of reasons why people might vote early, one obvious motivation is to
                  avoid the struggle of voting on a work day.

                <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Provisional Votes</h3>
                <p>Provisional ballots give people a chance to vote when they otherwise couldn't. Usually, a person acquires a provisional
                ballot when their voting eligibility cannot be validated. These special ballots are typically set aside and then determined
                to be either legitimate or not. States have different procedures for provisional votes. The end results of provisional ballots
                cast in the wrong precinct are depicted in the map above. However, the states also differ in what can warrant a provisonal ballot.
                Some states, for example, give out provisional ballots when a person's name or address changes. Some states will not give
                provisional ballots under such circumstances. There are also various methods for addressing provisional ballots at a later date,
                which either requires some action from the voter, such as definitively proving eligibility, or a careful inspection by local
                elections officials. Finally, there are different reasons for nullifying provisional ballots. One of the most common reasons is
                that the voter is not registered. Some places are stricter, requiring voters to show a valid photo ID in certain time frame lest
                they reject the provisional ballot.
