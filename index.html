        <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Welcome</h2>
        <p>From the federal level to the local level, governments in the United States of America have been 
          proposing, passing, and implemeting policies and laws that influence people's ability to vote in
          the country. This website briefly presents recent data pertaining to state legislation on voting. 
          While there are many laws that impact one's ability to vote during a given election in the country,
          several important ones are presented in the map above and explained in more detail below.
          Some states are more enabling than others, passing laws that make it easier to vote. Other states are
          stricter, making it more difficult to vote. This data is especially relevant now as many states
          have gotten stricter with their voting laws, with one key moment being the decision reached in the
          <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em> Supreme Court case in 2013.
        </p>
        <h3 id="paragraphTitle">Background</h3>
        <p>People need to meet certain requirements before they are able to vote in the United States. 
          One requirement is that one must be a U.S. citizen. Citizenship eligibility has changed throughout
          the nation's history, which, among other privileges, has affected voting eligibilties of certain people.
          The Fourteenth Amendment largely contributed toward the ability for African Americans to vote. As
          another example, the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was the first step toward U.S.-born Native Americans
          voting.
        </p>
        <p>In both of these cases, however, other laws had to pass and be implemented for mass enablement, 
          especially at the state level. For example, individual states still prohibited Native Americans from 
          voting despite their status as citizens.
