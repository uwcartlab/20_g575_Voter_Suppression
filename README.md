### Final Proposal
    1. Persona/Scenario
        1. Persona
        The prototypical user of our interactive tool about voter suppression would be from the general public. Such a hypothetical user would not usually be concerned with the politics of voter accessibility, but would be concerned with them after learning about various restrictive laws. Being of the general U.S. public, the user would encounter our tool online, as in a case of reading an online news article or scrolling on a social media site. After being presented with important background overview knowledge about voting restrictions, the main goal would be to learn about the current state of voting restriction in the U.S. Certain objectives pertaining to this goal include identifying which places have restrictive laws and policies, comparing places (e.g. user's home state vs. neighboring state) by number and type of restrictive laws, and delineating spikes of restrictive laws through time, simultaneously comparing time periods (e.g. 2020 vs. 2000) with each other. Our persona would preferably have more questions after evaluating this information, like how to act against voter suppression.
